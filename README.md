Hello, I’m Xiao Meng, proud to be a Wuhan University graduate in Computer
Science. I’ve been a passionate web developer for the past decade, with the
last two years committed to freelancing and engaging in open-source projects.
I find joy in creating my own products, as it allows me to constantly challenge
myself and innovate. When I’m not juggling codes, you will find me immersed in
gaming, listening to music, or pursuing my fascination with calisthenic
workouts. My A# is A00478456 and my preferred email is novoreorx@gmail.com.

We are together because we are all facing delays in obtaining our visas, which
has led to our absence from classes. However, we are determined to join the
program and have confidence in overcoming the visa issue and catching up with
the class. Therefore, we have formed a team and will work together as a group.
Each one of us will be in charge of a course and will help the others with it.
I know it may seem strange since the initial idea of forming a group is to find
similar interests, but even though it started with an accident, I believe we
will learn from each other and boost the study process.

Now let’s meet the group:

- Xiao Meng

  Xiao Meng comes from China. He loves programming, especially foud of the
  methodologies in Software Engineering. He believes that software development
  is not just about efficiency and algorithms but also about understanding the
  needs and intentions of end-users. MCDA is the starting point for him to
  expand his knowledge in a professional academic environment and explore his
  research interests further.

  Fun fact: He once wrote a very simple CLI called httpstat, which was
  recommended by a Google employee and quickly became a trending project.

- Wei Wang

  Wei Wang, a seasoned software developer from Shanghai, China, is motivated
  by innovation and the rise of artificial intelligence in his field. His knack
  for building and repairing extends beyond programming to constructing
  bicycles, servers, and custom data analysis tools. His creations
  echo his personal values: speed in his bicycles, durability in his servers,
  and insightful financial market analysis. Wei Wang's passion for travel
  inspired him to create a hiking group, where he aims to swap fascinating
  tales of adventure.

- Mohammad Pakdoost

  Mohammad Pakdost hails from Iran, having graduated from the Khavaran
  Institute of higher education in July 2018 with a degree in Computer
  Engineering. Since 2020, he has been working as a QA test engineer, yet his
  passion for programming spurred him towards a quest for self-improvement and
  learning. His ambition led him to join MCDA to broaden his academic horizons.
  Besides his academic pursuits, Mohammad’s interests lie in exploring nature.
  As an avid hiker, he routinely wanders through diverse landscapes every
  fortnight, pushing his physical and mental boundaries, finding solace away
  from everyday demands, and creating cherished memories with friends.
