Hello, I’m Xiao Meng, proud to be a Wuhan University graduate in Computer
Science. I’ve been a passionate web developer for the past decade, with the
last two years committed to freelancing and engaging in open-source projects.
I find joy in creating my own products, as it allows me to constantly challenge
myself and innovate. When I’m not juggling codes, you will find me immersed in
gaming, listening to music, or pursuing my fascination with calisthenic
workouts.

We are together because we are all facing delays in obtaining our visas, which
has led to our absence from classes. However, we are determined to join the
program and have confidence in overcoming the visa issue and catching up with
the class. Therefore, we have formed a team and will work together as a group.
Each one of us will be in charge of a course and will help the others with it.
I know it may seem strange since the initial idea of forming a group is to find
similar interests, but even though it started with an accident, I believe we
will learn from each other and boost the study process.

Now let’s meet the group:

- Xiao Meng

  Xiao Meng comes from China. He loves programming, especially foud of the
  methodologies in Software Engineering. He believes that software development
  is not just about efficiency and algorithms but also about understanding the
  needs and intentions of end-users. MCDA is the starting point for him to
  expand his knowledge in a professional academic environment and explore his
  research interests further.

  Fun fact: He once wrote a very simple CLI called httpstat, which was
  recommended by a Google employee and quickly became a trending project.
